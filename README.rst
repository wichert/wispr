This package provides a simple ``wispr`` command-line tool to authenticate
against a WISPr server.

WISPr (short for Wireless Internet Service Provider Roaming) is a standard for
authentication on WiFi hotspots. It is supported by many hotspots, and used by
all roaming providers.

This client can do three things: check for presence of a WISPr-capable gateway,
perform a WISPr login and perform a WISPr logoff.
